I'm a Research Scientist at the [Pacific Biological Station](http://www.pac.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/science/facilities-installations/pbs-sbp/index-eng.html) with
Fisheries and Oceans Canada in Nanaimo, British Columbia.
I link theory with data through statistical and simulation models to improve predictions about ecological systems and inform management and policy decisions.
In particular, I am interested in spatiotemporal species distribution modelling, how we can estimate population status with limited data, and in the role of variance, risk, and extreme events in population dynamics.

My [research](/cv.html#publications) broadly spans the field of quantitative
ecology. In my role at Fisheries and Oceans Canada, I am focused on marine fish and fisheries. My current areas of research include:

- Ecological extremes in time or space, e.g. [black-swan events](http://www.pnas.org/content/114/12/3252)
- [Ensemble approaches](https://doi.org/10.1111/faf.12200) in fisheries stock assessment
- Fisheries stock assessment, especially data-limited management-procedure approaches
- [Spatiotemporal modelling](https://doi.org/10.1002/ecy.2403) of fish biomass and other ecological processes, especially to investigate effects of climate change
- Ecological portfolio effects, e.g. [the benefits and risks of diversification for fishers](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1702506114) or [fish populations](https://doi.org/10.1890/14-0266.1)

I [teach workshops](/workshops) on statistical modelling and data science
in R including multiday workshops on [Generalized Linear Mixed Effects
Models](https://github.com/seananderson/glmm-course) (GLMMs), [Bayesian data
analysis in R and Stan]( https://github.com/seananderson/bayes-course), and
[advanced R](https://github.com/seananderson/adv-r-course).

I develop a number of R packages. For example, with collaborators, I'm developing packages to fit predictive process spatiotemporal GLMMs (generalized linear mixed effect models)
([sdmTMB](https://pbs-assess.github.io/sdmTMB/index.html) and [glmmfields](https://github.com/seananderson/glmmfields)), 
fit Bayesian statistical models used for COVID-19 forecasts for British Columia and Canada ([covidseir](https://github.com/seananderson/covidseir)),
run fisheries stock assessment simulations with [Stock
Synthesis][nefsc] software ([ss3sim](https://github.com/ss3sim/ss3sim)),
and fit Bayesian
Dynamic Factor Analysis time series models
([bayesdfa](https://github.com/fate-ewi/bayesdfa)). 
I also maintain [R packages](https://github.com/pbs-assess) to facilitate rapid
data processing, model fitting, and visualization for groundfish stocks on Canada's West Coast and to facilitate reproducible data-to-document workflows for CSAS (Canadian Science Advisory Secretariat Research) reports ([csasdown](https://github.com/pbs-assess/csasdown)).

I am interested in taking on postdoctoral researchers and co-supervising
graduate students. There are funding opportunities with Fisheries and Oceans
Canada. Other excellent
funding opportunities are through NSERC/Mitacs, [Liber Ero](http://liberero.ca/), and the
[Smith Fellows](https://conbio.org/mini-sites/smith-fellows). If you
have a topic of interest, get in touch and we may be able to write a joint
proposal.
